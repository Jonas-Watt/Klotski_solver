    "It was fun to do the Klotski challenge, but it's more efficient to just brute force Klotski. It took me less than half a second to find all 25955 possible positions (counting every similar block as equal). The shortest solution has 116 single steps and every configuration can be reached in 137 steps.\n",

    "With recursion and backtracking, I got my solution in 2 seconds, but it required 3873 single steps (or 20928 steps when I forgot counting every similar block as equal)."
